## 📋 Executive Summary

<table>
<tr>
<td>

Over **63%** of total revenue originates from just three customer states, while sellers based in São Paulo alone contribute more than **64%** of platform revenue. These patterns indicate strong demand but significant concentration risk and clear opportunities for territory and seller optimization.
