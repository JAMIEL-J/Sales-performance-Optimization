## ✅ Assumptions

<table>
<tr>
<td>1️⃣</td>
<td>Only <strong>delivered orders</strong> were considered as completed revenue-generating transactions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2️⃣</td>
<td><strong>Item price</strong> is used as a proxy for revenue due to the absence of cost and margin data.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3️⃣</td>
<td><strong>Freight value</strong> is included in gross revenue but not treated as profit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4️⃣</td>
<td>Sellers with <strong>fewer than 10 orders</strong> were excluded from seller performance analysis to reduce noise.</td>
</tr>
</table>

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

<table>
<tr>
<td>🚫</td>
<td>No product cost or margin data was available; <strong>profitability analysis was not possible</strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>📅</td>
<td>Analysis is based on <strong>historical transactional data</strong> and does not reflect real-time performance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>👁️</td>
<td>Customer behavior prior to purchase (views, clicks) was <strong>not available</strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>🗺️</td>
<td>Geographic analysis is limited to <strong>state-level granularity</strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>⏰</td>
<td>Results are constrained to the <strong>time period covered by the dataset</strong>.</td>
</tr>
</table>

## 🧠 Analytical Impact

<table>
<tr>
<td>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> While the analysis accurately captures **sales distribution**, **territory concentration**, and **seller performance patterns**, conclusions should be interpreted as **revenue optimization insights** rather than profitability recommendations.
